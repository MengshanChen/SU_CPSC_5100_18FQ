# Assignment #1

This is a discussion of the first assignment. Note that I said that there are no
incorrect answers. However, I do expect a thoughtful approach to the question and
a clear explanation of your thoughts. Again, this question was not intended as a way
for you to discussion whether requirements are important to a project. It's to
critically examine the presented requirements engineering process and present
your thoughts on it.

## The assignment

We discussed four possible phases in a possible requirements development process.
Clearly the process involves some level of iteration over the various phases, and
we've shown those in class.

Are there other processes that could be used for the requirements development process?
If so, what would those processes look like? Would they be iterative as well?

If you are of the opinion that this is a reasonable, useful, and defensible process,
what changes might you make to close any gaps?

Finally, discuss the timeframe in which your chosen process operates and why it
operates that way.

## Comments and notes

This is a three-part question. The first part is asking you to consider the process we
discussed in class (see the picture above) and present alternatives to that model. The
second part is asking if the process, as presented, is "reasonable, useful, and defensible".
That is, do you believe that the process we've discussed would work, and to point out
any gaps that might be present (there are likely many). The third part asks you to
revisit your proposed process through the lens of time. That is, you are asked to discuss
what shapes, in terms of time, your process steps take.
