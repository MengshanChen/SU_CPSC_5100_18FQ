# Quiz 1 answer notes

This is my thoughts on an answer for quiz 1.

## The question

Why is it important to create an organization that respects the requirements process?

## Answer

What I'm looking for here is a discussion around two key words in the question. The
first is _respects_ and the second is _process_. I don't want an explanation of a / an / the
requirements process. That much we should all understand at this point. Instead, I want
to focus on answering the question "why should we respect any process". Notice that this
is a slight rephrasing of the presented question, but still conveys the concept. I also
did not want a discussion about _why_ requirement management is a good thing. That's
been covered in class and in the literature. I think we can all agree that having some
idea of what you're building is probably a good thing.

So, we need to make sure the organization and stakeholders understand that we are going
to follow some process while determining this whole requirements thing. We are doing this
so that

* every stakeholder's voice is heard and understood
* there's a mutual level of respect around the set of tasks we're trying to accomplish
* that this journey is not, by any stretch of the imagination, perfect
* mistakes will be made, changes will be required
* and that we're going to learn from each other

Remember that I've said that much of the requirements process is about understanding
our stakeholders' needs and wants. We're going to ask them to explain what it is that's
most important to them _in terms of the problem domain_ so that we can help them to
accomplish that set of needs and wants. This is not always a comfortable discussion for
the reasons we discussed in class.
