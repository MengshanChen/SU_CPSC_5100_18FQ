## Course Learning Objectives

* An understanding of the requirements process
* Impact of requirements on the SDLC
* The different approaches managing requirements
* What "modern" requirements look like
* How to do requirements

## Reading Materials

Most materials for this class will be provided by the instructor. I may recommend texts during
the quarter that you might find interesting for background material and for general "keeping
on the shelf" help. There is no shortage of texts describing software requirements, the requirements
process, or the costs associated with ignoring them. If you want more recommendations, ask me.

We will extensively cover the materials in, and draw from, the following text. I'll try to assign
reading from the text prior to the lecture(s) that will cover the material. However, sometimes I
change things around, so we'll do the best we can do.

Note: the text is skewed heavily toward enterprise software development. That doesn't mean it
isn't useful for commercial software. It just means that there are subtle differences and I'll
try to point them out as we go.

* Vision and scope document
* Business requirements document
* Software requirements specification
* User classification

### Assignment #1

The [first assignment](assignments/ASSIGN-1.md) is due 17 October by the end of class at 20:05, in my inbox. 

## Grading

### High-level

This class is graded on the following scale. Over the course of the quarter you will be given, via homework, exams, projects, and participation, the opportunity to earn 100 points. Exams may include an "extra credit" opportunity. An "A" grade is easily achievable in my courses, but you will need to put in the work.

* 95+ points - A
* 90+ points - B
* 85+ points - C

### Course assignment and grading breakdown

This is a tentative break-down, I'll adjust during the first week(s) of class based on class size and experience.

* Outside reading assignments (1-pagers)
* The BRD (paper)
* The SRS (paper)
* Use cases and user stories (paper, UML, etc.)
* In-class discussions
* Pop quizzes in-class

Software engineering is a team process and one of the most important parts of that is communication. This includes both written and verbal. As such, the exams will be essay format (to include requirements artifacts as necessary). I also *expect* full classroom participation in discussions. Feel free to voice your opinions and disagree with what you're learning. That's part of the process. But do so in a respectful manner.

You will be expected to present matertials to the class. These presentations are usually short (10 minutes), concise, and expected to cover information from the class.

## Class structure

We have 2 hours twice a week. Each class will consist of a 10 - 15 minute class discussion of any reading assignment or outside work from the previous week. We will then take 90 minutes to cover the night's materials with a short break approximately half-way through. On Wednesdays we will spend the final 15 minutes covering the assignment for the week.

Occasionally we will have one or more of you presenting to the class. I'll schedule these as appropriate.

## Attendance policy

Class attendance is strongly encouraged. Students missing a class are responsible for any material assigned or covered in class during their absence. Active participation in the class discussions and activities is expected and it could influence your grade in boundary cases. Punctual attendance is highly encouraged as late arrival is distracting for everyone in the class.

## Personal Electronics Policy

Cellphone usage is not permitted in class. Turn them off and put them out of sight. You may use a laptop or tablet to take notes but do not use them to surf the web, chat, Snapchattagrammabook or catch up on email. No electronic equipment may be used during the exam unless otherwise instructed. If you have work issues to deal with I completely understand. But, take them outside. We'll catch you up when you get back.

## Homework Policy

_Late homework will not be accepted. You are responsible to make sure your assignment is submitted before the deadline. Late submissions will receive a zero. Individual extensions will only be given in extraordinary circumstances communicated with the professor before the deadline._

Please follow the specific instructions and submission policy for each assignment. Your assignment may be submitted on paper to the instructor. In the case of an electronic submission, make sure that your submission is in Microsoft Word or PDF format (ZIP, text or image files are not accepted). Also submit a single document and make sure all your figures are included in your main document. You are responsible to make sure that your file is not corrupted and that it is readable by the instructor. All submissions must include your name.

## Workload Expectation

You are expected to keep up with the course material. This includes completion of the reading assignments that are posted in the lecture notes and / or schedule. Unless explicitly noted, you are responsible for all assigned material even if a topic was not covered during the lecture.
This is a five-credit hour class, and consequently you are required to spend at least 10 hours per week outside of class to prepare for the course, study material, and work on homework assignments or project.

## Courtesy

* Students are responsible for all materials covered in class.
* Turn off all cellphones, pagers, etc.
* If you use a laptop to take notes, make sure all other applications (email, IM, Snapchattagrammabook, etc.) are off during the class.
* Strive for punctuality but if extenuating circumstances cause you to be late, please take a seat at the front of the classroom.
* If you have a work thing that arises during class, take it outside please.
* If you're running late send the instructor or a fellow student a text / email so we know if / when to expect you (yes, I might hold class start some days given weather or traffic conditions).

## Grading Dispute Policy

If you feel that part of your homework or exam was graded incorrectly, you may contact me within a week from when the exam or assignment was returned to you.

## Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is the unacknowledged use of the work or intellectual property of other persons, published or unpublished, presented as one's own work. All students are expected to work on all individual assignments independently. Collaboration on individual assignments is considered cheating and will be penalized accordingly. Other examples of behavior that is not tolerated in this class include copying all or part of someone else's work and submitting it as your own, sharing your assignment solution with other students in the class, consulting with another student during an exam, and copying text from published literature without proper attribution. If you have questions about what is allowed, please discuss it with the instructor. All students are responsible for reading and following the Seattle University Academic Honesty Policy. Students who violate University standards of academic honesty are subject to disciplinary sanctions, including failure in the course and suspension from the University.

## Notice for Students Concerning Disabilities

If you have, or think you may have, a disability (including an 'invisible disability' such as a learning disability, a chronic health problem, or a mental health condition) that interferes with your performance as a student in this class, you are encouraged to arrange support services and/or accommodations through Disabilities Services staff located in Loyola 100, (206) 296-5740. Disability-based adjustments to course expectations can be arranged only through this process.

## Academic Resources

Please take advantage of the academic support services available to you at the university. Even if you have had excellent study skills in the past, it is easy to slip into suboptimal habits and these services can help you excel in your studies.
