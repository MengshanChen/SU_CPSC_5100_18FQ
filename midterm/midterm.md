# CPSC 5100 Agile Requirements Midterm exam

Please answer the following 5 questions and return to me by 8:00. There’s a 6th question that can be used as a bonus. The overall exam is worth 20% of your quarterly grade, but not more than that (that is, answering the bonus question AND all of the others won’t net you more than 20%). When you are finished with the exam you are free to leave.

This is a closed book exam. You may not use notes from class, my slides, or any of the other reading materials that I linked.

As we've discussed in class, I'm looking for you to think outside of the box on many of these questions. There's a reason why you won't find the _exact_ answer to a question in the notes: it's because we haven't covered the exact scenario and you'll need to think about how you would address that scenario.

### The questions

1. Why do we present _Customer Bills of Rights and Responsibilities_, and to whom would they be presented?
2. What does Brooks mean when he describes _accidental_ difficulties and in what way(s) does this related to _essential_ difficulties?
3. Describe the four phases of requirements development. What are they, how do they relate, and who are the primary actors involved in each?
4. Describe the overall requirements elicitation process. There are four phases, what are they, and how do you know you’re done?
5. What are some of the characteristics that define the _Product Manager_ and _Product Owner_ roles? In what ways are they similar and in what ways are they different (and why)?
6. (bonus) How is a _Vision Statement_ similar to a _User Story_ and in what ways are they very different?
